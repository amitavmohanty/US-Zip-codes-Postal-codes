# US-Zip-codes-Postal-codes
US Zipcodes / Postal Codes as MySQL Dump - .sql

A list of United States Zip codes (Postal codes) with State, City, etc. in sql format that can be directly imported to a MySQL database.
This should simplify the process of having a local copy of US zipcode database...

There are many such sources available. I have picked from GeoNames.

Parent data source: GeoNames ( www.geonames.org )
